This repository is about some Python practices with common problems to help you understand the basic usage of Python syntax. 
Read the requirement specifications and think independently, every practice shows different useful knowledge about Python learning.

## quick start:
The practices are from easy to hard, generally, you can simple follow the [Python tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) to accomplish the following questions.

check the file /spec. for detailed specifications.
check the file /src/package_Swing. for sample codes. 
Notice that the code isn't always perfect, you can write your own code using what you've learned. What really matters is keeping learning and practice.

let's learn Python together! Fighting!~ :P
