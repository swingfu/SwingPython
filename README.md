# SwingPython
This repository is about some Python practices with common problems to help you understand the basic usage of Python syntax. 
Read the requirement specifications and think independently, every practice shows different useful knowledge about Python learning.

## quick start:
The practices are from easy to hard, generally, you can simple follow the [Python tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) to accomplish the following questions.

1. A simple program to convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
   - learn about basic input, condition control and loop.
     
2. Calculate the basic Statistics of the inputing list of numbers.
   - learn about the data structure of List
   - error handling (exception)
   - basic mathematics
     
3. Contact list which supports CRUD operations.
   - learn about how to use Class
   - List or Dictionary to store data
   - the usage of functions

4. Implement a Dialpad utility funcation that can be used by apps.
   - Iteration
   - using Dictionary

6. Implement a function to fetch Chinese city weather information for a given city.
   - Basic HTTP and JSON libraries
   - Using Aliyun account and APIs

7. Implement a simple Contact List with data persisted in MongoDB.


check the file /spec. for detailed specifications.
check the file /src/package_Swing. for sample codes. 
Notice that the code isn't always perfect, you can write your own code using what you've learned. What really matters is keeping learning and practice.

let's learn Python together! Fighting!~ :P
