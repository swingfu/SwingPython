This repository is about some Python practices with common problems to help you understand the basic usage of Python syntax. 
Read the requirement specifications and think independently, every practice shows different useful knowledge about Python learning.

   - learn about how to use Class
   - List or Dictionary to store data
   - the usage of functions

4. keep updating...

check the file /spec. for detailed specifications.
check the file /src. for sample codes. 
Notice that the code isn't always perfect, you can write your own code using what you've learned. What really matters is keeping learning and practice.

let's learn Python together! Fighting!~ :P
